# You Don't Need to Leave Your Room

## About

[YDNTLYR](http://youdontneedtoleaveyourroom.com/) is a dumb thing by [@jmdickinson](https://twitter.com/jmdickinson). It tiles an image as the background of a web page. See it tile. Become mesmerized by gif motion.

## How it Works

1. Hit the base URL for a random image. Click the button to refresh and get a new one.
2. To share an image, click the link in the top right.
3. Alternatively, pass your favorite image by url variable:

```
http://youdontneedtoleaveyourroom.com/?b=IMGURL
```

**Note:** IMGURL must have *http://* removed.

## Why I Made It

What's better than a great image? A tiled background of that image. What's better than sending a reaction GIF? Sending a page of that GIF tiled.

* Edges bleed together creating a [seamless background](http://youdontneedtoleaveyourroom.com/?i=72).
* Motion can create a [psychedelic undulation](http://youdontneedtoleaveyourroom.com/?i=75).
* The more [epic the image](http://youdontneedtoleaveyourroom.com/?i=55), the more of it you want to see.
* For [everything else](http://youdontneedtoleaveyourroom.com/?i=65), it's just kind of cool.

## What's the Name Mean?

The name is a declaration of support for the hours we spend at our computers, totally engaged and entertained by what we find.

It's also a quote from Franz Kafka that serves as the Prologue of the book *Still Life with Woodpecker* by Tom Robbins:

> *You don’t need to leave your room.*
> *Remain sitting at your table and listen.*
> *Don’t even listen, simply wait.*
> *Don’t even wait.*
> *Be quite still and solitary.*
> *The world will freely offer itself to you.*
> *To be unmasked, it has no choice.*
> *It will roll in ecstasy at your feet.*

## A Growing Library

If you use option #3 above and provide your own image it gets added to the list so people visiting the main page have a chance to see it.

Over time, this will grow into a fantastic list of the most epic images. Or just fill up with filth.

I will delete anything I deem too vulgar. Where that line is drawn depends on the day.

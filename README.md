# You Don't Need to Leave Your Room

## About

YDNTLYR is a dumb thing by @jmdickinson. It tiles an image as the background of a web page. See it tile. Become mesmerized by gif motion.

## How it Works

1. Hit the base URL for a random image. 
2. To share a certain image, click the link in the top right.
3. Alternatively, pass your favorite image by url variable:

```
http://youdontneedtoleaveyourroom.com/?b=*IMGURL, NO http://*
```

## Why I Made It

What's better than a great image? A tiled background of that image. What's better than sending a reaction GIF? Sending a page of that GIF tiled.

Edges bleed together creating a [seamless background](http://youdontneedtoleaveyourroom.com/?i=73).

Motion can create a [psychedelic undulation](http://youdontneedtoleaveyourroom.com/?i=76).

The more [epic the image](http://youdontneedtoleaveyourroom.com/?i=56), the more of it you want to see.

For [everything else](http://youdontneedtoleaveyourroom.com/?i=66), it's just kind of cool.

## A Growing Library

If you use option #3 above and provide your own image it gets added to the list so people visiting the main page have a chance to see it.

Over time, this will grow into a fantastic list of the most epic images. Or just fill up with filth.

I will delete anything I deem too vulgar. Where that line is drawn depends on the day.
